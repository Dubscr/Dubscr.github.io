<div align="center"><h1>Who am I?</h1></div>

Hi, my name is Tyler! I am a college student, game developer, musician, and programmer. I have been developing games on unity since 2020 and have released many games, some of which are on steam. I have been making music since 2022, some of my work including themes to games of my own and others. More recently I have been branching out into more programming oriented projects such as python scripts to automate tasts, as well as this website.

<div>This is a video I made about a popular motorsport calling "Rally." I had been obsessed with it for some time, so I tried replicating some of the most popular rally games through Unity. This video goes into great detail about my experience, and explains the basics of the technicalities of cars.</div>
