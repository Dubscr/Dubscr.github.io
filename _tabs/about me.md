<div align="center"><h1>Who am I?</h1></div>

Hi, my name is Tyler! I am a college student, game developer, musician, and programmer. I have been developing games on unity since 2020 and have released many games, some of which are on steam. I have been making music since 2022, some of my work including themes to games of my own and others. More recently I have been branching out into more programming oriented projects such as python scripts to automate tasts, as well as this website.
