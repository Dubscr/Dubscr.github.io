<div align="center"><h1>Who am I?</h1></div>

Hi, my name is Tyler! I am a college student, game developer, musician, and programmer. I have been developing games on unity since 2020 and have released many games, some of which are on steam. I have been making music since 2022, some of my work including themes to games of my own and others. More recently I have been branching out into more programming oriented projects such as python scripts to automate tasts, as well as this website.

<div>Untitled Ghost Game is a completely free multiplayer 2D ghost hunting game that you can play with friends. The game took me nearly two years to make, and it was my first ever multiplayer game. Lots of issues came about in late development due to this, although I learned an incredible amount through this game.</div>

<div>Dubscr's Murder Mystery is a multiplayer Social Deduction Murder Mystery Game. I wanted to make a game that i personally enjoy quite a bit, one that I could play with some friends and unwind. I did this through adding features such as: mines, smoke grenades, tasers, custom maps, player customization, and more to put my own spin on the genre.</div>

<div>Reclaim is an an adrenaline fuelled, action-driven arcade-y fps with fast paced movement and intense combat. I have been friends with the developer for quite some time and I am actually making the entire OST for his game! It is really cool being able to make such different themes for one game, from the ambient song "Whales", to the crushing atmospheric "Abandoned" I had tons of fun working on the game's themes.</div>
