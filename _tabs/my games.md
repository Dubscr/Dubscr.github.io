<div>Untitled Ghost Game is a completely free multiplayer 2D ghost hunting game that you can play with friends. The game took me nearly two years to make, and it was my first ever multiplayer game. Lots of issues came about in late development due to this, although I learned an incredible amount through this game.</div>

<div>Dubscr's Murder Mystery is a multiplayer Social Deduction Murder Mystery Game. I wanted to make a game that i personally enjoy quite a bit, one that I could play with some friends and unwind. I did this through adding features such as: mines, smoke grenades, tasers, custom maps, player customization, and more to put my own spin on the genre.</div>
